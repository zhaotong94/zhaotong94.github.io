      <description>I would like to apply for a postdoctoral position in the AI-related field. I have a multidisciplinary background in mathematics, AI, high-performance computing and following advantages:
Curiosity, Adaptability, and Self-Motivation. I am capable of working independently and eager to learn new knowledge, even willing to adopt a doctoral student mindset. I aim to contribute to highly original research. Additionally, I am open to discussing ideas with group members and assisting in guiding PhD students. Computational Resources. Due to my professional experience in the High Performance Computer Research Center, I have established good collaborative relationships with some leading supercomputing companies, internet companies, as well as distributed training centers in universities and research institutes. If necessary, I can provide the required computational resources for our group. Relevant Theoretical Foundation. I obtained my Ph.D. in the School of Mathematical Sciences, with strong algorithm analysis skills and the ability to learn new theories.</description>
